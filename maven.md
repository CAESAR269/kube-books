 **Here's a tabular representation of Maven lifecycle phases, commands, examples, and usage:**

| Phase          | Command          | Description                                       | Example Usage       |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| validate       | mvn validate     | Validates the project's structure and configuration | mvn validate  |
| initialize     | mvn initialize   | Initializes build state, sets properties, creates directories | mvn initialize |
| generate-sources | mvn generate-sources | Generates source code for inclusion in compilation | mvn generate-sources |
| process-sources | mvn process-sources | Processes source code, such as filtering values | mvn process-sources |
| generate-resources | mvn generate-resources | Generates resources for inclusion in the package | mvn generate-resources |
| process-resources | mvn process-resources | Copies and processes resources into the target directory | mvn process-resources |
| compile         | mvn compile       | Compiles the source code of the project           | mvn compile |
| process-classes | mvn process-classes | Post-processes generated files from compilation (e.g., bytecode enhancement) | mvn process-classes |
| generate-test-sources | mvn generate-test-sources | Generates test source code for inclusion in compilation | mvn generate-test-sources |
| process-test-sources | mvn process-test-sources | Processes test source code | mvn process-test-sources |
| generate-test-resources | mvn generate-test-resources | Generates test resources | mvn generate-test-resources |
| process-test-resources | mvn process-test-resources | Copies and processes test resources | mvn process-test-resources |
| test-compile    | mvn test-compile   | Compiles the test source code                    | mvn test-compile |
| test            | mvn test          | Runs unit tests                                  | mvn test |
| prepare-package | mvn prepare-package | Perform actions required before packaging (e.g., create JAR manifest) | mvn prepare-package |
| package         | mvn package       | Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR) | mvn package |
| pre-integration-test | mvn pre-integration-test | Perform actions required before integration tests | mvn pre-integration-test |
| integration-test | mvn integration-test | Runs integration tests                            | mvn integration-test |
| post-integration-test | mvn post-integration-test | Perform actions required after integration tests | mvn post-integration-test |
| verify          | mvn verify        | Runs checks on the results of integration tests | mvn verify |
| install         | mvn install       | Installs the packaged artifact into the local repository | mvn install |
| deploy          | mvn deploy        | Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository | mvn deploy |

**Key Points:**

- **Phase Order:** Phases execute in the order listed.
- **Running a Phase:** Execute all preceding phases by running a specific phase.
- **Goals:** Each phase is bound to specific plugin goals that execute the actions.
- **Customization:** Customize the lifecycle by binding goals to different phases in the project's POM.
- **Clean:** `mvn clean` removes generated files from previous builds.
- **Site Generation:** `mvn site` generates project documentation.
- **Release:** `mvn release:perform` performs release-related tasks.
