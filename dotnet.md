 **While I can't create tables directly, I'll present the information in a clear format for easy understanding:**

**Key Lifecycles and Phases in `dotnet`:**

**Default Lifecycle (Most Common):**

| Phase | Description | Example Command |
|---|---|---|
| `validate` | Checks project structure and configuration. | `dotnet validate` |
| `restore` | Downloads dependencies from specified sources. | `dotnet restore` |
| `clean` | Deletes build outputs. | `dotnet clean` |
| `build` | Compiles code and creates build outputs. | `dotnet build` |
| `test` | Runs unit tests. | `dotnet test` |
| `publish` | Publishes the application or library. | `dotnet publish` |
| `pack` | Creates a NuGet package. | `dotnet pack` |

**Other Common Lifecycles:**

**Clean Lifecycle:**

| Phase | Description | Example Command |
|---|---|---|
| `preclean` | Pre-clean operations. | `dotnet preclean` |
| `clean` | Deletes build outputs. | `dotnet clean` |
| `postclean` | Post-clean operations. | `dotnet postclean` |

**Publish Lifecycle:**

| Phase | Description | Example Command |
|---|---|---|
| `publish` | Publishes the application or library. | `dotnet publish` |
| `publish-local` | Publishes to a local directory. | `dotnet publish-local` |
| `publish-run` | Publishes and runs the application. | `dotnet publish-run` |

**Additional Notes:**

- To execute a specific phase, use `dotnet <phase>` (e.g., `dotnet publish`).
- To run all phases in a lifecycle, use `dotnet build` (for default lifecycle).
- To view available phases and goals, use `dotnet help build`.
